# A-Detection
A concept drift-based runtime reliability anomaly detection approach for edge services adaptation. It employs reservoir sampling, SVD and JS divergence to measure the distribution dissimilarity of reliability data stream by constructing new and old streams matrices.

***Please refer to the following paper for a detailed description of the A-Detection approach:
